### Step 1: 
> truffle compile (to compile the contracts)
> truffle test (to test the smart contract functionality)

> truffle migrate (to deploy them - Ganache blockchain)<br>

#### Or if you want to reset the state of your contracts on the test blockchain run

> truffle migrate --reset
--------------------------------------------
### Step 3: Inside another terminal window in the project do:
> cd client <br>
> npm install
